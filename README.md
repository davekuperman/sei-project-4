# PantryPilot

PantryPilot is a web application that helps users generate recipes based on the ingredients they have in their pantry. It allows users to input their available ingredients and then generates recipes using those ingredients. Users can also save their favorite recipes for future reference.

## Technologies Used

PantryPilot is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. PantryPilot utilizes React to create a dynamic and interactive frontend.
- **Chakra UI**: A component library for building accessible and customizable user interfaces. Chakra UI is used to style and design the user interface of PantryPilot, providing a consistent and visually appealing look and feel.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment. PantryPilot uses Node.js for server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **Express**: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express is used to build the backend server and handle routing and API requests.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database. PantryPilot utilizes PostgreSQL to persist recipe and user information securely.


## Project Approach

PantryPilot follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend and backend components communicating via RESTful APIs. The frontend is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface for inputting ingredients and viewing generated recipes. The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express, handling API requests and interacting with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve recipe and user information.

For the styling and design of the application, Chakra UI is used to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. The color scheme and overall theme aim to create a warm and inviting feel for users.
